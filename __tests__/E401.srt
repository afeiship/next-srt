00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:12,016
We can read of things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write.

2
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:17,601
But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write.

3
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:30,475
The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas-- legends handed down from one generation of storytellers to another.

4
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:39,300
These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, 

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,504
but none could write down what they did.

6
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:52,814
Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from.

7
00:00:52,814 --> 00:01:01,018
The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.

8
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:10,579
But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten.

9
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:19,745
So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from.

10
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:26,364
Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint,

11
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:30,438
because this is easier to shape than other kinds.

12
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:36,379
They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away.

13
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:48,870
Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.
